# [MSP - *Mais Simples Possível*](table-of-contents.md)

# Introduction

The purpose of this manual is to describe the assembly programming language MSP.

MSP is the acronym for *Mais Simples Possível* (Portuguese for *The Simplest Possible*) and, with effect, it is quite a simple language, with a reduced number of instructions and with a very accessible syntax and semantics.

The MSP language is meant to program a [Stack-based Virtual Machine](architecture.md).
