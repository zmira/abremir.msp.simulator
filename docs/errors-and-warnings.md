## Errors and Warnings

---

This chapter will present, and discuss, the different circumstances that will generate errors or warnings during the assembly of a MSP program.

A warning is an alert for a condition that, event though it is not an obstacle to generate executable code, may be a symptom that something is not semantically correct. The program may be compile but there's no guarantee that there are no errors at runtime! Hence the separation between assembly errors and runtime errors.

For each error and warning you will be given a code, a short description, a longer description, and, when deemed needed, a code example to generate the error or warning.
